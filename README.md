# Supermarket-Navigation-System
This project is a real-time in-store navigation and inventory management system designed to enhance customer shopping experiences and optimize store operations. Built with Python (FastAPI) on the backend and a map-based interface on the frontend, it provides dynamic routing, inventory visibility, and seamless navigation within retail environments.

🔎 Key Features

Real-Time Navigation: A pathfinding engine runs on a 30×50 grid store layout, enabling customers to find the shortest route to selected products or sections.

Dynamic Map Overlay: A visual interface displays the store map, item locations, and suggested paths for smooth navigation.

Inventory Management: Store staff can update stock levels and item positions, ensuring that product availability is always accurate.

Future BLE Integration: Plans include Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacon support to track live customer positions inside the store for precise real-time navigation.

Scalable Backend: Powered by FastAPI, the backend is lightweight, high-performance, and ready for deployment on Docker/Kubernetes.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Backend: FastAPI, Python

Frontend: ReactJS (planned), interactive map rendering

Database: PostgreSQL / SQLite for product and layout data

Deployment: Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible automation

🚀 Use Cases

Shoppers: Quickly locate items without needing assistance, reducing frustration and improving satisfaction.

Store Managers: Manage product placement and stock levels, and monitor customer flow for better layout decisions.

Retail Analytics: Future extensions include heatmap generation and data insights for store optimization.

🌟 Vision

This system is more than just a navigation app—it’s a smart retail assistant. By merging AI-driven pathfinding, IoT tracking (BLE), and inventory intelligence, it aims to create a connected shopping experience where customers save time and retailers gain actionable insights.
